            This is the anti small talk podcast. We love a good conversation and refuse to settle for half baked half
            hearted chatter!
          </p>

          <p>
            Why are good conversations important? Why are stories important? How do stories told long ago shape the
            world around us today? Find some answers as this podcast undresses the written word, urban legends, song
            lyrics and burrows into some film subtexts, linking imaginative literature through eras and regions.

            Welcome to The Emergency Exit, a light hearted but sharp minded podcast that centres around the pleasures of
            reading: Onaissa Abbasi and her guests scout their way to a much needed escape into the realm where words
            make sense, reminding us that there is yet elegance and meaning in the world despite. So let's open a book
            and exit into the world of literature and the arts…

          <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold text-[#181e3a] mt-16 mb-8">Our Mission</h3>

          <p>
            This podcast is for people who enjoy engrossing conversations - and how stories can be read again and again.
            Here we form unexpected connections with contemporary life, referencing culture, cinema and the arts. For
            fellow aficionados of the written word, this podcast is the emergency exit into inspired conversations; the
            idea came about from our passion for literature and how the rereading of existing classics in the
            contemporary world can be an exciting rediscovery.
          </p>

          <p>
            As we sit down with our coffees, our conversations throw open the magic casement on imaginative thought.
            Listen to us weave our way through novels, stories, movies and poetry; things get curiouser and curiouser!
            Picking up particular literary and artistic sources, we discover plays within the play, finding fascinating
            tidbits and trivia, tracing how artists and authors express human emotion, and how much of that affects our
            postmodern worldview.
          </p>

          <p>
            So watch this space; we will be sharing striking literary experiences with our listeners, how re-exploring
            fiction can be rewarding once we draw our audience's attention to the joy of literature. And on the way,
            convince some of you to read the titles on the table!
